					<p>I'm a UI/UX Designer who moved 2,073 miles from the Midwest in search of a competitive and challenging career.</p>

					<p>While doing web design, I always felt something was missing from my job. It wasn't until I started learning UX that I found the answer: people. Ever since, I have been obsessed with learning how people think and using those discoveries in my designs.</p>

					<p>I use other skills from my journalism and web design background such as web programming and writing. To keep from becoming stagnant, I try to throw in a challenge for myself in each project. Much of my work is varied in style.</p>

					<p>However, I donâ€™t work all the time (even though it feels like it some weeks). In my free
						time, I
						love
						playing the Sims, listening to EDM, or watching Design Star on HGTV. My biggest
						inspirations
						are
						from David Carson, Jan Tschichold and Salvador Dali.</p>

						<p>I do try to attend as many design or UX meetup groups as possible, so please say hi if you
							see me
