							designers.</p>

							<p>I like to think I do this at my current job as a web designer at Healthx, a web portal
								company. I
								also use my other skills such as UX, web programming and writing. To keep from becoming
								stagnant, I
								try to throw in a challenge for myself in each project. Much of my work is varied in
								style. I
								like to call myself a “mixed bag,” due to starting in a journalism
								background.</p>

								<p>However, I don’t work all the time (even though it feels like it some weeks). In my free
									time, I
									love
									playing the Sims, listening to Tool, or watching Design Star on HGTV. My biggest
									inspirations
									are
									from David Carson, Jan Tschichold and Salvador Dali.</p>

									<p>I do try to attend as many design or UX meetup groups as possible, so please say hi if you
										see me
										there.</p>

										<p class="about-desc-header">Veerkamp Visuals Got a Facelift</p>

										<p>It always starts with the question: How do you define yourself and design style?</p>

										<p>One of my strengths is art direction, so the main image on my homepage is a photo illustration. Despite groaning from the paper throwers, we finally got a money shot. The rest was Photoshop magic. The overall design of my portfolio reflects my style, which is sometimes illustrative and mimics deconstructivism.</p>
