<h3>Student Ad</h3>
<p>This project was part of an independent study. I spent several weeks researching the history of advertising and Leo Burnett's legacy. Because I had such a good experience during the photoshoot for GRID Magazine, I used the same photographer for a fake Coca-Cola Ad from the 60s. In this shoot, the lighting was critical. I also found inspiration for the final ads from orginal Coke ads.</p>
