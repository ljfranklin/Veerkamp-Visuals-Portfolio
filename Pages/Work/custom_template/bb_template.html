<h3>Ball Bearings Online Magazine</h3>
<p>Ball Bearings was my home while in college. The online magazine showcases print journalism stories, photo galleries, websites and interactive infographics. I spent long hours working in the office, starting as a flash designer. I eventually became the web editor my senior year. This job entailed creating a new website with a CMS system. I built the website with two student developers. My role included the design and some HTML, CSS, and PHP. I lead our team to create a website that is still used four years later and has won several awards for overall website and website design in student journalism.</p>
