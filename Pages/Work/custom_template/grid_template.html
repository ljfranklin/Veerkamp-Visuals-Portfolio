	<h3>GRID Magazine, student project</h3>
	<p>My favorite class in four years was a magazine design class. I created a magazine from scratch, including all the photos and stories. The best part of the magazine was the feature story. I wrote a story about the relationship between designers, developers and how each thinks and interacts with the others. I chose to call the story "Breaking Barriers" because I found many similarities between the two fields.</p>

	<p>I also got the opportunity to direct a photoshoot for my story. I gathered any old electronics I could find, and invited several people to the demolition party. We dropped an old monitor from a ladder, and the photographer got the shot of the screen exploding when it hit the ground. Several shots were used throughout the spread, along with a edgy design style.</p>
