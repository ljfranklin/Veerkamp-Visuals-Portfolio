	<h3>Health Place</h3>
	<p>Healthx is a health insurance web portal software company. The entrepreneurial CEO came up with a vision for the future of Healthx. He wanted to integrate the use of mobile and tablet health app data with the portals. Doctors and patients could coordinate using the app and see the data in our portals. The portal would also serve as a communication tool, giving alerts to doctors and patients if data was showing a health risk. Some devices that would be used are asthma trackers, weight scales, or blood pressure cuffs. Health Place is the name of the web application and app store that could be integrated with a Healthx portal. My role was the UI Designer on this project.</p>
	<p class="work-header">Planning and Observation Phase</p>
	<p>This project was my first introduction to user experience. Although the majority of my responsibilities were to design the UI, I worked with the interaction designer closely to learn more about his craft. He designed the flowcharts, but I helped with the wireframes. I first learned and used Axure so that users could interactively test the wireframes. The interaction designer and I informally user-tested few medical professionals and stakeholders.</p>

	<p class="work-header">Iteration and UI Phase</p>
	<p>During this phase, I first made a style tile. Then, I began the long process of design and repeat until the UI was ready. Last, I converted my Fireworks design file into an HTML wireframe, so that sales people could use it for demos.</p>
	<p class="work-header">Version 1.0 Release</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, this idea has yet to begin development. However, the groundwork has been created if the application is to be built in the future.
