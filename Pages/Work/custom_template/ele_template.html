<h3>Save Elephants Mockup</h3>
<p>Towards the end of my college career, I landed an internship several states away at <a href="http://www.352media.com">352media.com</a>. The User Experience Director asked the design interns to create a website about something that inspired us. I tried to pick a style that would require me to practice my drawing skills. Several of the items on my mockup were drawn then edited in Photoshop. Overall, I feel the design was good practice for a skill that needed some work.</p>
