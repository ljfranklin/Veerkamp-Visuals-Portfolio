<div class="span6"><h3>LISA LIVEWARE</h3>
	<p>LISA is an internal tool for spa management at a new spa company called Marylin Monroe Spas. This web application was my first major freelance project. I coordinated with several remote developers and project managers for a year. LISA's functions included creating and editing tasks between users, making announcements, planning schedules, and keeping documents or company diary entries. Although we didn't have an official user experience designer, I informally made some of those decisions, such as the flow for tasks. My role on the project was UI Designer and front-end programmer. Because this application would be used at several locations, I created themes using LESS. A programmer could change colors and graphic styles in one LESS file, or use my system to create a client-facing theme page.</p>
	<p class="work-header">Wireframes</p>
	<p>Having not had a user experience education at this point, I jumped in to wireframes (If only I had known not to do this, then!) But, I guess it shows that I have grown since that time to now see my past mistakes. Anyways, I used wireframes to plan the layout and design choices. I was also researching LESS at this time to determine if it would be the right language to help with making CSS themes.</p>

	<p class="work-header">Design and Programming</p>
	<p>During a year, which included a few allnighters, I spent most of my time refining the design, styling the HTML/CSS, making the application responsive, or designing different themes. </p>
	<p class="work-header">Version 1.0 Release</p>
	<p>The first version of our web application is currently in production, with several spas using the product. Our next steps will be to reassess the application and do user interviews to get feedback. More features will be added as the demand grows.</p>
