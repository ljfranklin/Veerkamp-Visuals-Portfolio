<p class="work-header">Research Phase</p>
<p>When brought on to the Enplug team, I had almost no formal training in user experience. However, I was given the opportunity to lead a web application project and learn as I went along. I started by getting some UX books and taking online courses.</p>
<p>My first task was to interview the primary stakeholders, my two bosses in this instance. In addition, an older version of the app already existed, so I did my own user testing and got answers to some of the goals and decisions made in the previous app. From this information, I started to build the first use cases. Next, I constructed wireframes in Fireworks which I eventually made into an HTML wireframe using bootstrap and static images.</p>
<p>I didn't want the project to get too far along before interviewing users and user testing my basic wireframes. I conducted several interviews with restaurant or small business owners, our target audience. From this information, I started to develop personas and identify patterns in user behavior.</p>
<p class="work-header">Iteration and UI Phase</p>
<p>Now that I had a good idea of my users' needs, goals, and motivations, I started designing. I made a graphic file in Fireworks for the front-end developer. I would also help style with HTML/CSS using LESS. During the last fourth of the project, I conducted some hallway testing. I used this information to once again refine the design several times. </p>
<p class="work-header">Version 1.0 Release</p>
<p>The web application was released and is a vast improvement from the original application. However, there is always more work to be done. Our team is now deciding the most important priorities for a second iteration, using Agile management techniques for organization.
