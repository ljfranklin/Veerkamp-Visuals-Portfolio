	<h3>The Enplug Control Panel</h3>	
	<p>Enplug is a digital billboard company with large, vertical TV screens, called AURA displays, that display live social media posts and custom images. Enplug screens are located in restaurants, stores or other commercial businesses. The AURA display is controlled by a web application called the Enplug Control Panel. My role was the lead UI/UX Designer on this application.</p>
	<p class="work-header">Research Phase</p>
	<p>When brought on to the Enplug team, I had almost no formal training in user experience. However, I was given the opportunity to lead a web application project and learn as I went along. I started by getting some UX books and taking online courses.</p>
	<p>My first task was to interview the primary stakeholders, my two bosses in this instance. In addition, an older version of the app already existed, so I did my own user testing and got answers to some of the goals and decisions made in the previous app. From this information, I started to build the first use cases. Next, I constructed flowcharts and wireframes in Fireworks which I eventually made into an HTML wireframe using bootstrap and static images.</p>
	<p>I didn't want the project to get too far along before interviewing users and user testing my basic wireframes. I conducted several interviews with restaurant or small business owners, our target audience. From this information, I started to develop personas and identify patterns in user behavior.</p></div>

		<p class="work-header">Iteration and UI Phase</p>
		<p>Now that I had a good idea of my users' needs, goals, and motivations, I started designing. I made a graphic file in Fireworks for the front-end developer. I would also help style with HTML/CSS using SASS. During the last fourth of the project, I conducted some hallway testing. I used this information to once again refine the design several times. </p>
		<p class="work-header">Version 1.0 Release</p>
		<p>The web application was released in mid-January 2014 and is a vast improvement from the original application. However, there is always more work to be done. Our team is now deciding the most important priorities for a second iteration, using Agile management techniques for organization.
		</p>
		<p class="work-header">Advertising Module</p>
		<p>After launching the original web application, our team decided to create a module that would eventually be integrated in the Enplug Control Panel. This advertising module will serve as a creation and monitoring hub for new advertisements on our screens, as well as a CRM tool for clients and Enplug ad designers. Initial research, interviews, flowcharts and wireframes are currently underway.</p>
