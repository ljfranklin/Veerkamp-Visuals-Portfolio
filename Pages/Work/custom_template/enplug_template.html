<h3>The Enplug Control Panel</h3>
<p>Enplug is a digital billboard company with large, vertical TV screens, called AURA displays, that display live social media posts and custom images. Enplug screens are located in restaurants, stores or other commerical businesses. The AURA display is controlled by a web application called the Enplug Control Panel. My role was the lead UI/UX Designer on this application.</p>
<h3>My Process</h3>
<p class="work-header">Research Phase</p>
<p>When brought on to the Enplug team, I had almost no formal training in user experience. However, I was given the opportunity to lead a web application project and learn as I went along. I started by getting some UX books and taking online courses.</p>
<p>My first task was to interview the primary stakeholders, my two bosses in this instance. In addition, an older version of the app already existed, so I did my own user testing and got answers to some of the goals and decisions made in the previous app. From this information, I started to build the first use cases. Next, I constructed flowcharts and wireframes in Fireworks which I eventually made into an HTML wireframe using bootstrap and static images.</p>
<p>I didn't want the project to get too far along before interviewing users and user testing my basic wireframes. I conducted several interviews with restaurant or small business owners, our target audience. From this information, I started to develop personas and identify patterns in user behavior.</p>
<p class="work-header">Iteration and UI Phase</p>
<p>Now that I had a good idea of my users' needs, goals, and motivations, I started designing. I made a graphic file in Fireworks for the front-end developer. I would also help style with HTML/CSS using LESS. During the last fourth of the project, I conducted some hallway testing. I used this information to once again refine the design several times. </p>
<p class="work-header">Version 1.0 Release</p>
<p>The web application was released in mid-January 2014 and is a vast improvement from the original application. However, there is always more work to be done. Our team is now deciding the most important priorities for a second iteration, using Agile management techniques for organization.

<h3>Problem and Solution</h3>
<p>P: Administrative users can see or control what a venue (small business owner)'s can see.</p>
<p>S: Administrators can select a venue to see their dashboard from the administrative homepage or use a toggle on the navigation bar to avoid going back to the home page each time they would like to switch to another venue.</p>

<p>P: Some venues own multiple businesses, but they need to be able to see any location's dashboard.</p>
<p>S: Venues with more than one location are classified as chain owners. The toggle used for administrators to switch between venues is used in a similar manner for chain owners. Chain owners can see their locations on a home page or use the toggle to switch between them.</p>

<p>P: Venue owners can edit settings that will flag a social media posts as profanity. These settings need a specific place to be find easily.</p>
<p>S: Links to settings are put in an obvious place for users within the page where social media posts appear. Also, the settings link is highlighted in the sidebar to stand out from the other links in its collapse.</p>
